# LANtransfer
A project for transferring files on LAN.
It's actually just a wrapper over netcat, but the command is a hundred times easier to type and remember. Thus, to run it, you'll need to have netcat installed. 


To send a file, use the command `send file.txt [ip]`.


To receive a file, use the command `receive`.
